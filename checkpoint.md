# NovaPay — Project Checkpoint

> **Purpose:** the single source of truth that carries state across weeks. Sonnet updates this as it executes; Opus reads it at the start of each weekly planning session so plans never scatter. Update the "Last updated" line every edit.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-14 (D4 complete; D5 next) · **Current phase:** Phase 1 (Linux & Systems Foundations) — *common core, discipline-neutral* · **Current week:** Week 1 (Day 1 ✓ Day 2 ✓ Day 3 ✓ Day 4 ✓; Day 5 next) · **Status:** in progress

> **★ Decision pending:** discipline (SRE / DevOps / Platform) is deliberately **undecided** until the **Week-20 Decision Checkpoint**. The foundation is build-first and neutral until then. See the decision-gate section below.

## Locked decisions (carry forward; change only deliberately)
- Repo `novapay-sre`, public. Name retained for continuity — a **label, not a discipline commitment**.
- **Discipline deliberately undecided.** SRE vs DevOps vs Platform is chosen at the **Week-20 Decision Checkpoint**, from experience — not up front. Weeks 1–20 are the discipline-neutral **common core**.
- **Foundation orientation: build-first — build for correctness, depth-first.** Study failure modes only to **harden** against them (every timeout, retry cap, invariant check is a defense); do **not** manufacture incidents. Reproducibility + demonstrable correctness are the measure. (Break-on-purpose / chaos returns **post-checkpoint, mainly in the SRE lane**.)
- Build path: **minimal payments core, self-built, built for correctness.** No clone, no real PSP, no PCI scope. Reference Blnk + a Go/Postgres double-entry tutorial for patterns only.
- System: `payment-api` (Go) + `fake-psp` (Go) + Postgres double-entry ledger + Redis (later). Grows into the full AWS/EKS/observability/AI stack over the year.
- Core invariant: per payment, sum(debits) == sum(credits). Non-negotiable; do not slim the ledger to a single balances table. Deep concurrency treatment (isolation levels, row locking) is **Week 7**.
- **Dev→deploy workflow: build & test on WSL2 → deploy to EC2 via Ansible.** WSL2 = IDE/build box (Neovim, Go, local Postgres); EC2 = runtime/deploy target. No hand-copying — deployment goes through Ansible (platform-eng muscle from day one).
- **Planning workflow: Opus plans the week → Sonnet executes → checkpoint carries to next week.**
- **Scope ceiling:** build only what **deepens a core competency** (correctness, concurrency, systems, observability, reproducibility); post-checkpoint, also what serves the chosen lane. No payment features for their own sake.
- Cadence: build **daily**, publish **one deep-dive weekly** (build/learning through the foundation; lane-specific after the checkpoint), comment on 5–10 posts daily.
- Cert backbone: SAA → CKA → Terraform Associate → DevOps Pro (discipline-flexible); CCA-F as differentiator. End goal: Canada, NOC 21231.
- Day numbering: weeks run Day 1–7 at real pace, not weekday-locked.

## ★ Upcoming decision gate — end of Week 20
After Phase 4 (SAA + CKA + Terraform Associate earned, full stack built correctly), **the executing model STOPS and asks: SRE, DevOps, or Platform?** Do not plan Week 21+ until answered. The chosen lane sets the spine of Weeks 21–34, decides whether break-on-purpose/chaos becomes the model (SRE) or stress-testing (DevOps/Platform), and whether the scope ceiling stays tight (SRE) or relaxes (DevOps/Platform). **Soft-lean pulse ~Week 10:** log a one-line tilt (not a decision) so the gate isn't a cold start.

## Architecture build progress
| Component | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `payment-api` | Go service, charge path, idempotency | scaffolded (`/healthz` ✓); charge path + idempotency = Day 2 |
| `fake-psp` | Go stub bank with latency/error/hang knobs | scaffolded; `/authorize` + latency/hang knobs ✓; error-rate knob = Day 4 |
| Ledger | Postgres double-entry (local this week → RDS Week 7) | Day 2 (local Postgres: WSL2 for dev, EC2 local for deploy) |
| Redis | idempotency/cache | deferred (DB unique-constraint handles idempotency this week) |
| systemd | both services managed | Day 3 |
| Ansible | provision + deploy (the IaC workflow) | provision ✓; deploy playbook = Day 3 |
| Observability | CloudWatch + Prom/Grafana + SLOs | Phase 2 |
| Terraform | whole stack as code | Phase 4 |
| AI agent | triage → MCP → gated remediation | post-checkpoint (AIOps, ~wk 29+) |

## Incident catalog (legacy) + foundation hardening
**Incident catalog (legacy + post-checkpoint):**
- 0001 — (existing, pre-v2) — logged
- 0002 — (existing, pre-v2) — logged
- **No new incidents during the foundation.** The former "planned incidents" (runaway CPU, zombies, stuck payment) are now **Week-1 hardening tasks**, not incidents. Incident/chaos work **resumes post-checkpoint, if the SRE lane is chosen.**

**Foundation hardening status (Week 1 resilience properties):**
- [ ] Idempotency real — repeated key moves no money (Day 2)
- [ ] Balance invariant holds, incl. under concurrent load (Day 2; deep treatment Week 7)
- [ ] Bounded retries — backoff + jitter + cap (Day 4)
- [ ] Correct goroutine/process lifecycle — no leaks/zombies (Day 5)
- [ ] Timeouts — context deadline + client timeout — + graceful shutdown (Day 6)

## Weekly log
### Week 1 — Phase 1: Build a correct payments core + harden it at the process boundary
- **Goal:** build `payment-api` + `fake-psp` on one EC2 box (deployed via Ansible) under systemd, with a correct local double-entry ledger; **harden** the service 3 ways at the process boundary (bounded retries; timeouts + graceful shutdown; correct goroutine lifecycle).
- **Day status:** D1 ☑ D2 ☑ D3 ☑ D4 ☑ D5 ☐ D6 ☐ D7 ☐
- **Built (so far):** WSL2 build env (Go 1.24.3, gopls, Ansible, Neovim); EC2 provisioned via Ansible (Go + Postgres + app/log dirs); `payment-api` (`/healthz`) + `fake-psp` (`/authorize` + latency/hang knobs) scaffolded, compiling, smoke-tested; binaries git-ignored; committed + pushed. `POST /charge` with double-entry ledger (pgx/v5, single transaction, two balanced ledger entries); idempotency enforced via `UNIQUE(idempotency_key)` — repeated key returns original result at latency_ms=0, moves no money; structured `slog` JSON logging (request_id, idempotency_key, latency_ms, psp_status); invariant query confirmed 0 rows; committed + pushed. systemd unit files for `payment-api` and `fake-psp` (restart-on-failure, journald logging, start-on-boot); Ansible `deploy.yml` (builds binaries locally via `delegate_to: localhost`, copies to `/opt/novapay/bin/`, installs unit files, sets up EC2 Postgres user + database via shell module, applies schema, `daemon-reload`, `enable --now`); both services deployed and active on EC2 via single Ansible command; ledger invariant holds on EC2 database (0 rows); committed + pushed. `PSP_ERROR_RATE` knob added to `fake-psp` (returns HTTP 500 on a random fraction of `/authorize` calls); bounded retry in `payment-api` (max 3 attempts, HTTP 5xx only, full-jitter exponential backoff: `random(0, min(1s, 100ms×2^attempt))`), `slog.Warn` on each retry; exhausted attempts return 503, DB transaction never opened — ledger invariant guaranteed on failure path; load-tested under `PSP_ERROR_RATE=0.5` (9/10 charges succeeded, 1 graceful 503, invariant 0 rows, failed charges wrote 0 DB rows); deployed to EC2 (commit `2eef3e9`); committed + pushed.
- **EC2 baseline (D3):** `payment-api` 1.9MB RAM · `fake-psp` 1.1MB RAM · ports 8080/8081 · structured logs to journald (`SyslogIdentifier=payment-api/fake-psp`) · restart-on-failure with 5s backoff · enabled (survives reboot) · 0 payments, invariant clean.
- **Hardening built:** D4 ✓ — bounded PSP retry (backoff + jitter + cap); verified CPU at baseline under 50% error rate. D5–D6 pending.
- **Published:** _(build/learning deep-dive — Day 7 — link/title)_
- **Carryover / unfinished:** _(anything to roll into Week 2)_
- **Notes for next planning session:** _(surprises, scope changes, what Opus should know)_

## Agentic workflow evolution log
_Updated each day. Tracks how the Claude Code workflow grows alongside NovaPay._

### Week 1 foundation (Days 1–3)
- CLAUDE.md: project intelligence file, read every session
- Custom commands: `/check`, `/deploy-dry-run`, `/deploy`, `/ec2-status`, `/ec2-logs`, `/ec2-invariant`, `/day-start`, `/commit`, `/test-charge`, `/load-test`
- PreToolUse hook: blocks `ansible-playbook` without `--check` (exit 2)
- PostToolUse hook: logs every bash command to `~/.claude/novapay-activity.log`
- MCP: Postgres (dev queries), GitHub (issue + PR workflow)
- `settings.json`: absolute hook paths, permissions allow/deny list

### Day 4 additions
- GitHub MCP workflow: observe failure → create issue → fix → close issue
- `/load-test` command: concurrent charge test under `PSP_ERROR_RATE`, invariant check
- Incident catalog habit: every hardening day generates a GitHub Issue

### Rule: each day adds at least one workflow improvement
Before committing Day N, ask: what does the Claude Code workflow gain today that it did not have yesterday?

## Handoff to next Opus planning session (Week 2)
**Next week is Phase 1, Week 2 — Filesystems, disk, memory (build-first).**
- **Build slice:** structured, rotated transaction logging + a sane disk layout (logs vs. data).
- **Harden:** bound disk use (rotation + retention) so a busy day can't fill `/`; understand the OOM killer and set memory limits so the ledger writer degrades predictably under pressure. (No staged outages — these are defenses built in; reproduce a fill/OOM once only to verify the defense.)
- **Publish angle:** "Designing a payments box that can't fill its own disk."
- **Prereqs that must be true before Week 2 starts:** `payment-api` + `fake-psp` running under systemd on EC2 (deployed via Ansible); ledger invariant holding + idempotency real; Week 1 hardening (bounded retries, timeouts, graceful shutdown, goroutine lifecycle) committed.
- **Resolved this week:** Postgres location — **local on WSL2 for dev, local on EC2 for the deploy target; RDS deferred to Week 7.** Receipt generation — **in-process goroutine** (not a shelled-out child), decided on Day 5.
- **Open questions to resolve as they arise:** _(Sonnet logs here.)_
- **Reminder:** discipline still undecided — **Decision Checkpoint at Week 20.**
